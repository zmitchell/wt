Create a worktree project by cloning a repository.

This is very similar to `wt init` except that instead of providing you with an
empty git repository the project is created by cloning a repository.

You may clone the project under a specified directory with the `-p/--path` flag.

By default the project will be named after the repository, but you may supply
another name with the `-n/--name` flag.
